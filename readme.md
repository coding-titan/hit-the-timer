# Hit the timer
## A game where you hit a timer, and try to get it as close to the specified time as possible.

The timer starts when the browser loads the webpage. It stops when you hit the button.

When you press the **Hit Me!** button, it shows when you clicked in relation to when the page loaded, and if that was before, after or the same as the random target generated above.

The "play again" button, revealed by pressing **Hit Me**!,  simply reloads the page, thus resetting the game.
